# What's New?!

![whats-new](/whats-new.png) 

Powershell functions for versioning a git repo with tags and more!

# Features 
...at a glance. For more details, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/refactorsaurusrex/whats-new/wiki).

## Semantically Versioned Git Tags

Easily add [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/) tags to your git commits with the following functions:

- `Add-MajorVersionTag`: Create a new tag with the *major* version incremented.
- `Add-MinorVersionTag`: Create a new tag with the *minor* version incremented.
- `Add-PatchVersionTag`: Create a new tag with the *patch* version incremented.
- `New-VersionTag`: Create a new tag with an *arbitrary* version number.

The *Major*, *Minor*, and *Patch* functions will find the most recent semantically versioned tag and use it as the basis for the incremention operation, following SemVer numbering rules. 

## Delete Old Local Git Branches

Delete all local branches in a git repo except for master. Useful for those moments when you realize you have an enormous number of obsolete branches that are ready for the big `-D`.

`Remove-LocalBranches`

By default, this will only remove merged branches. Use `-Force` to delete both [merged and unmerged branches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#git-branch--d).

## Open Visual Studio Solutions From The Command Line

Why fish around for Visual Studio solution files using Windows Explorer when you can find and launch them from your terminal window with just three little letters? Run `sln` (an alias for `Open-Solution`) to recursively search your current working directory for a solution file and launch it, if one is found.

## Remove Autogenerated Comments From PowerShell Module Manifests

When you use the `New-ModuleManifest` cmdlet to create a module manifest, it generates a _lot_ of comments that you may not want to keep. Run `Remove-ModuleManifestComments` to strip away that noise and make your manifest easy to read.
